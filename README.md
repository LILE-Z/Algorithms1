The repository is organized into folders, each representing a week of the course. The solutions are implemented in **Python**:

- **Week 1: Programming Challenges**  
  Introduction to solving basic programming challenges.

- **Week 2: Algorithmic Warmup**  
  Fundamental algorithmic concepts and problem-solving techniques.

- **Week 3: Greedy Algorithms**  
  Exploring greedy strategies to solve optimization problems.

- **Week 4: Divide and Conquer**  
  Problems utilizing the divide-and-conquer algorithmic paradigm.

- **Week 5: Dynamic Programming**  
  Solutions to problems using dynamic programming techniques.

## Languages

Although the repository supports multiple languages, the primary focus is on Python for all the solutions.
